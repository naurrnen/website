Nestled in the heart of Gran Imperio, the city of Ornasion stands as a monument to the relentless pursuit of knowledge and understanding. Often referred to as the "Citadel of Wisdom," Ornasion is a sprawling metropolis that is not just a city but also a colossal library complex, governed and meticulously maintained by the revered Archivist Guild. The citadel reaches from the far underground chambers to majestic towers piercing the sky, offering scholars, historians, and curious minds a trove of immeasurable wisdom.

Ornasion is a unique blend of architectural grandeur and scholarly solitude. It's a city where stone and parchment speak as eloquently as its inhabitants, where every carved archway and alcove may contain scrolls, tomes, or a secluded scholar engrossed in a millennia-old manuscript. Upon entering the city, one is greeted by a giant statue of Thalia, the ancient goddess of wisdom, symbolizing the city's dedication to the intellectual arts.

What sets Ornasion apart is its extensive underground labyrinth of archives. Delving deep beneath the city, thousands of chambers lie filled with texts from various eras, civilizations, and languages. Scholars from all over Naurrnen and beyond come here to sift through ancient scriptures, study transcriptions from the Laurië Citime, and engage in philosophical debates. The labyrinthine nature of the library serves as a metaphor for the complexity and depth of the knowledge it houses; its halls are a physical embodiment of the intricate networks of human thought and inquiry.

The Archivist Guild, the city's backbone, comprises a highly trained cadre of scholars, librarians, and documentarians who not only preserve and catalog the texts but also serve as academic mentors. The guild holds an annual symposium known as "The Conclave of Quills," inviting intellectuals to present their latest discoveries and theories. These events are major attractions, often yielding breakthroughs in various academic disciplines.

Above ground, the city is no less impressive. Ornasion's towers, reminiscent of castle spires, serve as specialized research centers. Whether it's astronomy, arcane arts, or anthropology, each tower is dedicated to a particular field of study. Scholars often take residence in these towers, contributing to ongoing research while enjoying a panoramic view of the city that stimulates the mind and inspires the spirit.

Security in Ornasion is unlike any other city. The Archivist Guild employs an elite force of mage-guards who protect the city and its invaluable knowledge. These mage-guards use a unique blend of magic and martial arts, honed through intense training to detect and neutralize any threats. In Ornasion, the pen might be mightier than the sword, but both are held in equal reverence.

Ornasion is not merely a city or a library but a living, breathing entity of intellectual endeavor. It offers a sanctuary for those who seek to understand the mysteries of the world and themselves. Whether you are a scholar aiming to decode the riddles of the ancients or a traveler in search of profound wisdom, Ornasion welcomes you with open arms and an open mind.
